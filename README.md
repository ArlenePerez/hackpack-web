# AthenaHacks Web Dev Hackpack

We'll be building an app that will take user input, save it to a database, and display it on the page. Building a full stack application like this means that you'll write front-end, back-end, and database code. Use this as a starting point and get familiar with all parts of the stack so you can hack a cool site at AthenaHacks!

## Getting Started

#### Installations
Make sure you have the following installed:

 - [Atom](https://atom.io/) or other text editor
 - [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): Homebrew is a package manager that makes it easy to install other packages. Install it by running the following command on your terminal:

    ```sh
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): Install this using Homebrew by running the following command on your terminal:

    ```sh 
    brew install node
    ```
 - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): SQLite is a file-based database. It is commonly used for development and testing and it's the easiest database to get started with. Install this using this command:
